    <h1>How to Add CSS</h1>
    <p>There are 3 ways to insert CSS in a web page, these are external css, internal css and inline css.</p>
    <h2>External CSS</h2>
    <p>With an external style sheet, you can change the entire look of a web page by changing just one file. This page,
        for example, was styled by an external CSS file.</p>
    <h2>Internal CSS</h2>
    <p>Internal style sheet can be used for one page and is defined inside the style element,located in the head tag.</p>
    <h2>Inline CSS</h2>
    <p style="color:teal">This can be used to style a single element</p>
        <h3>Multiple Style Sheets</h3>
        <p>Assume that a particular element was styled both on the external style sheet  and internal style sheet; If the link tag was placed before the style tag in the head section, the inline CSS would be used. If the link tag was placed after, the external CSS would be used. In terms of the cascading order, inline css is always the highest.</p>
