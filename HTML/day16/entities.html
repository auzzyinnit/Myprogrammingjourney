    <h2>Entities</h2>
    <p>Reserved HTML characters must be replaced with entities... e.g, less than = &lt; and greater than = &gt;</p>
    <p>example of an entity name is greater than = &gt;, while it's entity number is &#60;. Obviously,names are easier to remember.</p>
    <h3>Non-breaking Space</h3>
    <p>The non breaking space entity is = &nbsp;. This is a space that will not break into a new line.</p>
    <h3>Combining Diacritical Marks</h3>
    <p>A diacritical mark is a glyph added to a letter. examples include = a&#768; and o&#770;</p>
    <h2>Other symbols</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This is the euro sign = &euro;.</li>
        <li>This is the empty sets sign = &empty;.</li>
        <li>This is the delta sign = &delta;.</li>
        <li>This is the copy right sign = &copy;.</li>
        <li>This is the trademark sign = &trade;.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Emojis</h3>
    <p>Emojis look like images or icons, but they are not. Emojis are characters from the utf-8 character set. they can be copied,sized and displayed like any other character. Examples are below:</p>
    <ul style="font-size:3em;">
        <li>laughing emoji &#128514;</li>
        <li>smiling emoji &#128513;</li>
        <li>Love Emoji &#128151;</li>
    </ul>
